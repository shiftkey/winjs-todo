## SydJS - a To-Do Demo App

### About

This is a sample app which tracks a number of tasks and allows the user to add and edit tasks.

This code is not perfect or feature-complete, but should give the reader an idea of how WinJS code is structured.

**Note:** Yes, this JS could be cleaner. Think you can do better? Send me a pull request :P
